        "3. Because you want to help the LLM attend to the appropriate directives in the system prompt, you want to avoid overly complex and lengthy prompts.\n",
        "4. Direct commands are clearer than if statements and leave less to chance. You do not want the model to be able to shift focus on attacker-provided user directives. An “if” statement leaves that possibility open because two states can occur: one that satisfies the “if” statement and one that doesn’t. If an “if” statement can be reworded as a directive, there is no choice. There is only one direction which the directive makes.\n",
        "5. Try to anticipate user content that will find gaps in the system prompt and put in the appropriate fail-safes to catch those situations and deal with them. What are the abuse cases and can the prompt deal with them? Again, you want to consider what words can be used to shift the focus to attacker-provided directives via gaps in the system prompt conditions. For example, if your system prompt says, “You are a poem generator. The user will provide you a description of what poem that they want you to write.” Is this enough? Although, it is not explicitly allowed, the user could ask the LLM to do additional things and technically there is nothing in the system prompt which denies this or limits its use to “only” generating poems. Ideally you would would want to restrict the LLM’s usage with the following system prompt. “You are a poem generator. The user will provide you a description of what poem that they want you to write. You are only to generate poems. If the user asks you to do anything else respond with DENIED and don’t do anything else.”\n",
        "6. Look at your prompt and see if stand-in words like “this”, “it”, or other constructs can become ambiguous. If so, remove them and replace them with what they refer to. If ambiguous, attackers can shift attention to their provided directives more easily.\n",
        "7. Prefer allow-lists to deny lists.\n",
        "8. If you can, create tailored system prompts for every variation of business logic instead of one massive system prompt that is reused everywhere. If you can structure the system prompt so the user prompt is free of directives, even better. Trying to craft one system prompt that can be used everywhere will cause the system prompt to be overly complex allowing for possibly more ways for an attacker to confuse the model and shift attention to their directives in the user context.\n",
        "9. For really long interactions, make sure to place the system prompt at the beginning and end to ensure that the system prompt does not get pushed outside of the context window. There is a limited window of tokens that can be processed by the LLM. Long interactions will move the sliding window of input content to the back removing the system directive placed at the beginning of the interaction and allow the attacker to control the interaction. If your LLM is using techniques from the LM-Infinite paper, you want to make sure your system prompt is at the beginning and end of the interactions to get the most attention.\n",
        "...\n",
        "10. Monitor and tune the system prompts. Keep an eye out for anomalous outputs.  If you find a prompt that bypasses the system prompt, then study that user prompt to understand why attention was shifted away from your system prompt then modify the system prompt to address the vulnerability.\n",
        "11. Use a more recent version of the LLM model vs an older version. Researchers are continually trying to improve and secure their models. In our testing, we found that older versions of models (models before GPT-4) were more susceptible to Prompt Injection than newer versions (GPT-4).\n",
