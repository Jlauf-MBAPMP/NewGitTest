        "\n",
        "1. Compute the Probability\n",
        "\n",
        "For each word in a sequence, the language model estimates the probability of that word based on the words that came before it. For example, if we have a sentence \"The cat is on the mat,\" the model estimates the probability of each word given the previous ones, like P(\"cat\"∣\"The\")P(\"cat\"∣\"The\") and P(\"mat\"∣\"The cat is on the\")P(\"mat\"∣\"The cat is on the\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? This step helps us understand how likely the model thinks each word is, given the context. The model assigns a probability to each word, reflecting its confidence.\n",
        "2. Log Probability\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we take the logarithm (usually base 2) of each of these probabilities. For example, if P(\"cat\"∣\"The\")=0.2P(\"cat\"∣\"The\")=0.2, then log⁡2(0.2)log2​(0.2) is calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? Taking the logarithm helps in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "    It makes the multiplication of probabilities (which are often small numbers) more manageable by turning them into a sum of log probabilities.\n",
        "    It allows us to use a consistent scale (base 2) to measure the uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Average Log Probability\n",
        "\n",
        "After calculating the log probability for each word, we compute the average of these values across the entire sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? This gives us a single number that represents the overall \"surprise\" or uncertainty of the model for the entire sentence or document. It’s an average measure of how well the model predicts the text.\n",
        "4. Exponentiation\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we take the exponentiation of the negative average log probability to obtain the perplexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why? The exponentiation step converts the log-scale average back to the original probability scale, giving us the perplexity. Perplexity can be thought of as the effective number of choices the model has at each step in the sequence. A lower perplexity means the model has fewer choices and is more confident in its predictions.\n",

        "        P(\"sat\"∣\"The cat\")=0.3P(\"sat\"∣\"The cat\")=0.3\n",
        "\n",
        "    Log Probabilities:\n",
        "        log⁡2(0.1)≈−3.32log2​(0.1)≈−3.32\n",

        "\n",
        "    Average Log Probability:\n",
        "        Average = −3.32−2.32−1.743≈−2.463−3.32−2.32−1.74​≈−2.46\n",

        "    Perplexity:\n",
        "        Perplexity=22.46≈5.47Perplexity=22.46≈5.47\n",

The framework then processes these templates, filling in variables and executing generation commands at appropriate points. This method allows for precise control over the model's output, ensuring that it follows predefined patterns and formats. Key features include:\n",
